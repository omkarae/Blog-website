(1, 'USSR', 'This is Russia!!!', 'ussr', 'The Soviet Union,[n] officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics[o] (USSR),[p] was a transcontinental country that spanned much of Eurasia from 1922 to 1991. A flagship communist state, it was nominally a federal union comprising fifteen top-level republics;[q] in practice, both its government and its economy were built on a highly centralized model until its final years. It was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with the city of Moscow serving as the capital of both the federal state and the Russian SFSR, which was its largest and most populous republic. Other major cities in the Soviet Union included Leningrad (Russian SFSR), Kiev (Ukrainian SSR), Minsk (Byelorussian SSR), Tashkent (Uzbek SSR), Alma-Ata (Kazakh SSR), and Novosibirsk (Russian SFSR). It was the largest country in the world by land area, covering over 22,402,200 square kilometres (8,649,500 square miles) and spanning eleven time zones.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Union traces its origin to the 1917 October Revolution which saw the Bolsheviks, a far left-political party lead by Vladimir Lenin topple the Provisional Government and establish the RSFSR, the world\'s first constitutionally guaranteed socialist state.[r] The October Revolution followed the earlier 1917 February Revolution which saw the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II. Bolshevik seizure of power lead to a period of tension which erupted into the Russian Civil War, which pitted the Bolshevik lead RSFSR against their enemies, collectively called the White Army. In 1922, the White Army was defeated which spearheaded the creation of the Soviet Union and the reconstitution of the Bolsheviks into the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nFollowing Lenin\'s death and state funeral in 1924, Joseph Stalin the party\'s General Secretary assumed leadership over the party and country.[8] Beginning a period of Soviet governance guided by Stalinism he inaugurated a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization, which led to significant economic growth but also contributed to the Soviet famine of 1930–1933. His rule also saw the expansion of the labour camp system under the Gulag. Between 1936 and 1938, Stalin carried out the Great Purge, a campaign of political repression through which he solidified his power by removing his actual and perceived opponents. In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, opening up the Eastern Front of World War II. The combined Soviet civilian and military casualty figures—estimated to be around 27 million people—accounted for the majority of losses on the side of the Allies. The total defeat of the Axis in 1945 marked a formal cessation of hostilities, and the territories taken by Soviet forces subsequently formed various Soviet satellite states.\r\n\r\nBy 1947, newfound tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States had escalated into the Cold War. During this period, the Soviet-aligned Eastern Bloc confronted the American-aligned Western Bloc. The two sides consolidated their opposition to each other through ideology-based military alliances: the Warsaw Pact, which formed in 1955 to serve Soviet interests; and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which formed earlier in 1949 to serve American interests. Following Stalin\'s death and state funeral in 1953, a process of \"de-Stalinization\" was initiated by the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. The Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race with the first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1), the first human spaceflight (Vostok 1), and the first probe to land on another planet (Venera 7). Throughout the 1970s, there was a détente in Soviet Union–United States relations, but bilateral tensions resumed from 1979 onwards due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform the country through his policies of glasnost and perestroika. In the closing stages of the Cold War, various communist states were overthrown by the Revolutions of 1989, jeopardizing the Warsaw Pact. Unrest across the Eastern Bloc was also accompanied by the outbreak of strong nationalist/separatist movements within the Soviet Union itself. To address the question of the country\'s future preservation (or lack thereof), Gorbachev initiated the 1991 Soviet Union referendum—boycotted by the Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova—that resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favour of the New Union Treaty, which aimed to preserve the Soviet Union as a completely reformed country. Later that year, hardline members of the Communist Party staged the August Coup, which was unsuccessful in overthrowing Gorbachev\'s government; Boris Yeltsin played a high-profile role in facing down the unrest and the Communist Party was subsequently banned, accelerating the dissolution of the Soviet Union. By December 1991, all of the fifteen Soviet republics had emerged as fully independent post-Soviet states.\r\n\r\nThroughout its existence, the Soviet Union was responsible for many social and technological achievements and innovations. It was a founding member of the United Nations, and also held influence as one of the \"Permanent Five\" of the United Nations Security Council. It had the world\'s second-largest economy, which led and influenced the Second World during the Cold War. The Soviet Armed Forces, which comprised the world\'s largest standing military at their peak, also possessed the world\'s largest nuclear weapons arsenal.[6][9][10] Alongside the United States, the Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the two superpowers of the world from the end of World War II until its dissolution; it exercised global influence through its hegemony in the Eastern Bloc, military and economic strengths, various forms of aid to the Third World, and scientific research.[11]', 'russia.svg', '2022-10-20 15:20:50'),
(2, 'Stocks', 'From slums to towers in one night', 'stocks', 'Shares\r\nA person who owns a percentage of the stock has the ownership of the corporation proportional to their share. The shares form a stock. The stock of a corporation is partitioned into shares, the total of which are stated at the time of business formation. Additional shares may subsequently be authorized by the existing shareholders and issued by the company. In some jurisdictions, each share of stock has a certain declared par value, which is a nominal accounting value used to represent the equity on the balance sheet of the corporation. In other jurisdictions, however, shares of stock may be issued without associated par value.\r\n\r\nShares represent a fraction of ownership in a business. A business may declare different types (or classes) of shares, each having distinctive ownership rules, privileges, or share values. Ownership of shares may be documented by issuance of a stock certificate. A stock certificate is a legal document that specifies the number of shares owned by the shareholder, and other specifics of the shares, such as the par value, if any, or the class of the shares.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, and Australia, stock can also refer, less commonly, to all kinds of marketable securities.[4]\r\n\r\nTypes\r\nStock typically takes the form of shares of either common stock or preferred stock. As a unit of ownership, common stock typically carries voting rights that can be exercised in corporate decisions. Preferred stock differs from common stock in that it typically does not carry voting rights but is legally entitled to receive a certain level of dividend payments before any dividends can be issued to other shareholders.[5][6][page needed] Convertible preferred stock is preferred stock that includes an option for the holder to convert the preferred shares into a fixed number of common shares, usually any time after a predetermined date. Shares of such stock are called \"convertible preferred shares\" (or \"convertible preference shares\" in the UK).\r\n\r\nNew equity issue may have specific legal clauses attached that differentiate them from previous issues of the issuer. Some shares of common stock may be issued without the typical voting rights, for instance, or some shares may have special rights unique to them and issued only to certain parties. Often, new issues that have not been registered with a securities governing body may be restricted from resale for certain periods of time.\r\n\r\nPreferred stock may be hybrid by having the qualities of bonds of fixed returns and common stock voting rights. They also have preference in the payment of dividends over common stock and also have been given preference at the time of liquidation over common stock. They have other features of accumulation in dividend. In addition, preferred stock usually comes with a letter designation at the end of the security; for example, Berkshire-Hathaway Class \"B\" shares sell under stock ticker BRK.B, whereas Class \"A\" shares of ORION DHC, Inc will sell under ticker OODHA until the company drops the \"A\" creating ticker OODH for its \"Common\" shares only designation. This extra letter does not mean that any exclusive rights exist for the shareholders but it does let investors know that the shares are considered for such, however, these rights or privileges may change based on the decisions made by the underlying company.\r\n\r\nRule 144 stock\r\n\"Rule 144 Stock\" is an American term given to shares of stock subject to SEC Rule 144: Selling Restricted and Control Securities.[7] Under Rule 144, restricted and controlled securities are acquired in unregistered form. Investors either purchase or take ownership of these securities through private sales (or other means such as via ESOPs or in exchange for seed money) from the issuing company (as in the case with Restricted Securities) or from an affiliate of the issuer (as in the case with Control Securities). Investors wishing to sell these securities are subject to different rules than those selling traditional common or preferred stock. These individuals will only be allowed to liquidate their securities after meeting the specific conditions set forth by SEC Rule 144. Rule 144 allows public re-sale of restricted securities if a number of different conditions are met.\r\n\r\nStock derivatives\r\nFurther information: Equity derivative\r\nA stock derivative is any financial instrument for which the underlying asset is the price of an equity. Futures and options are the main types of derivatives on stocks. The underlying security may be a stock index or an individual firm\'s stock, e.g. single-stock futures.\r\n\r\nStock futures are contracts where the buyer is long, i.e., takes on the obligation to buy on the contract maturity date, and the seller is short, i.e., takes on the obligation to sell. Stock index futures are generally delivered by cash settlement.\r\n\r\nA stock option is a class of option. Specifically, a call option is the right (not obligation) to buy stock in the future at a fixed price and a put option is the right (not obligation) to sell stock in the future at a fixed price. Thus, the value of a stock option changes in reaction to the underlying stock of which it is a derivative. The most popular method of valuing stock options is the Black–Scholes model.[8] Apart from call options granted to employees, most stock options are transferable.', 'post-bg.jpg', '2022-10-20 16:10:59'),
(3, 'India', 'मेरा भारत महान', 'india', 'India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia. The nation\'s capital city is New Delhi.\r\n\r\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[26][27][28] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[29] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[30] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[31][32] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[33] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[34] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[35] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[36] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[37] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[38] but also marked by the declining status of women,[39] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][40] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[41]\r\n\r\nIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India\'s southern and western coasts.[42] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India\'s northern plains,[43] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[44] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[45] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[46] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[47] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][48] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[49] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[50][51] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[52] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[53][54] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[55][56][57][58] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[59]\r\n\r\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211 billion in 2011.[60] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[61] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[62] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[63] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[64] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[65] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[66] and rising levels of air pollution.[67] India\'s land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[68] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[69] India\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India\'s culture,[70] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.', 'india.svg', '2022-10-20 16:44:00'),
(4, 'Bali-The Heaven on earth', 'Bali- the once Hindu kingdom', 'bali', 'Bali (/ˈbɑːli/; Balinese: ᬩᬮᬶ) is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar,[7] is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali\'s cultural centre. The province is Indonesia\'s main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s.[8] Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy.[9]\r\n\r\nBali is the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with 86.9% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism.[3] It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events held in Bali include the Miss World 2013 and 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world\'s top destination in its Traveller\'s Choice award, which it also earned in January 2021.[10][11]\r\n\r\nBali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species, especially fish and turtles.[12] In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean.[13] Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[14] It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before Dutch colonisation.[15]', 'bali.jpg', '2022-10-20 16:53:35'),
(5, 'Angkor Wat - The ancient Hindu temple', '1000 years old Hindu temple', 'combodia', 'Angkor Wat (/ˌæŋkɔːr ˈwɒt/; Khmer: អង្គរវត្ត, \"City/Capital of Temples\") is a temple complex in Cambodia and is the largest religious monument in the world,[1] on a site measuring 162.6 hectares (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres).[2] Originally constructed as a Hindu temple[1] dedicated to the god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire by King Suryavarman II, it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century; as such, it is also described as a \"Hindu-Buddhist\" temple.[3][4]\r\n\r\nAngkor Wat was built at the behest of the Khmer King Suryavarman II[5] in the early 12th century in Yaśodharapura (Khmer: យសោធរបុរៈ, present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology: within a moat more than 5 kilometres (3 mi) long[6] and an outer wall 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs, and for the numerous devatas adorning its walls.\r\n\r\nAs the best-preserved temple at the site, Angkor Wat is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture. It is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists in Cambodia and around the world,[7] having played a major role in converting Cambodia into a Buddhist nation.[8] It has become a symbol of Cambodia,[9] appearing on its national flag, and is the country\'s main tourist attraction.[10]', 'Ankor_Wat.jpg', '2022-10-20 17:11:43'),
(6, 'Russia', 'This is Russia!!!', 'russia', 'Russia (Russian: Россия, tr. Rossiya, pronounced [rɐˈsʲijə]) or the Russian Federation,[c] is a transcontinental country spanning Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. It is the largest country in the world, covering over 17,098,246 square kilometres (6,601,670 sq mi), and encompassing one-eighth of Earth\'s inhabitable landmass. Russia extends across eleven time zones sharing land boundaries with fourteen countries,[15] more than any other country but China.[d] It is the ninth-most populous country in the world and the most populous country in Europe, with a population of 146 million. The country\'s capital and largest city is Moscow, the largest city entirely within Europe. Saint Petersburg is Russia\'s cultural centre and second-largest city. Other major urban areas include Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan.\r\n\r\nThe East Slavs emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE. The medieval state of Kievan Rus\' arose in the 9th century, and in 988 adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Rus\' ultimately disintegrated, with the Grand Duchy of Moscow growing to become the Tsardom of Russia. By the early 18th century, Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, the third-largest empire in history. The monarchy was abolished following the Russian Revolution in 1917, and the Russian SFSR became the world\'s first constitutionally socialist state. Following a civil war, the Russian SFSR established the Soviet Union with three other republics, as its largest and the principal constituent. The country underwent a period of rapid industrialisation at the expense of millions of lives. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II, and was a superpower and rival to the United States during the Cold War. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world\'s first human-made satellite and the launching of the first human into space.\r\n\r\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the newly independent Russian SFSR renamed itself the Russian Federation. In the aftermath of the constitutional crisis of 1993, a new constitution was adopted, and Russia has since been governed as a federal semi-presidential republic. Since his election in 2000, Vladimir Putin has dominated Russia\'s political system and Russia has experienced democratic backsliding, shifting into an authoritarian state. It ranks low in international measurements of freedom of the press and civil liberties and has high levels of perceived corruption.\r\n\r\nThe Russian economy is the world\'s ninth-largest by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest by PPP. It has the world\'s largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, with the fifth-highest military expenditure. Russia\'s extensive mineral and energy resources are the world\'s largest, and it is among the leading producers of oil and natural gas globally. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of the G20, the SCO, BRICS, the APEC, the OSCE and the WTO, as well as the leading member of the CIS, the CSTO, and the EAEU. Russia is home to 30 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.', 'russia.jpg', '2022-10-21 15:48:51'),
(7, 'Java', 'Wonderful Indonesia', 'java', 'Java (/ˈdʒɑːvə, ˈdʒævə/[1] Indonesian: Jawa, Indonesian pronunciation: [ˈdʒawa]; Javanese: ꦗꦮ; Sundanese: ᮏᮝ) is one of the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea to the north. With a population of 148.76 million people, Java is the world\'s most populous island, constituting approximately 55% of the Indonesian population.[2]\r\n\r\nIndonesia\'s capital city, Jakarta, is on Java\'s northwestern coast. Many of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of Indonesia\'s eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.\r\n\r\nFormed by volcanic eruptions due to geologic subduction of the Australian Plate under the Sunda Plate, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass at about 138,800 square kilometres (53,600 sq mi). A chain of volcanic mountains is the east–west spine of the island.\r\n\r\nFour main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, and Betawi. Javanese and Sundanese are the most spoken.[3] The ethnic groups native to the island are the Javanese in the central and eastern parts and Sundanese in the western parts. The Madurese in the Eastern salient of Java are migrants from Madura Island, while the Betawi in the capital city of Jakarta are hybrids from various ethnic groups in Indonesia. Most residents are bilingual, speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java\'s population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.[4]\r\n\r\nJava is divided into four administrative provinces: Banten, West Java, Central Java, and East Java, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.', 'java.jpg', '2022-10-21 16:40:55'),
(8, 'Diwali', 'दीपावली के हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं !!!', 'diwali', 'Diwali (English: /dɪˈwɑːliː/; Deepavali[3] (IAST: dīpāvalī) or Divali; related to Jain Diwali, Bandi Chhor Divas, Tihar, Swanti, Sohrai and Bandna) is a festival of lights and is one of the major festivals celebrated by Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs.[4] The festival usually lasts five days, or six in some regions of India, and is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar month Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November).[5][6][7] One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual \"victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance\".[8][9][10][11] The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity and Ganesha, god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles, with many other regional traditions connecting the holiday to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Furthermore, it is a celebration of the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile.\r\n\r\nIn the lead-up to Deepavali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colorful art circle patterns).[12] During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth,[a] light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared. Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain diaspora.[15][16][17]\r\n\r\nThe five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts. Diwali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami (Dussehra, Dasara, Dashain) festival, with Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as rangolis.[18]Some regions of India start Diwali festivities the day before Dhanteras with Govatsa Dwadashi. The second day is Naraka Chaturdashi. The third day is the day of Lakshmi Puja and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some parts of India, the day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and Balipratipada (Padwa). Some Hindu communities mark the last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent, which is dedicated to the bond between sister and brother,[19] while other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as Vishwakarma Puja and observe it by performing maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.[20][21]\r\n\r\nSome other faiths in India also celebrate their respective festivals alongside Diwali. The Jains observe their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira,[22][23] the Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal prison,[24] while Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally celebrate Diwali by worshipping the goddess Kali.[25][26][27] The main day of the festival of Diwali (the day of Lakshmi Puja) is an official holiday in Fiji,[28] Guyana,[29] India, Malaysia,[b][30] Mauritius, Myanmar,[31] Nepal,[32] Pakistan,[33] Singapore,[34] Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.[35]', 'diwali.jpg', '2022-10-21 18:09:53');
